<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><tt>WHBCS</tt> came into existence after I had a <tt>netcat</tt> chat with
an acquaintance, showing that such a client-less chat has both the merit of
not having to install a client and the expense of the other's messages
interrupting the own typing; additionally, only two people could participate
in such a conversation. After that, I wrote up <tt>WHBCS</tt>, trying to use
some ANSI escape codes to make others' messages appear above the own one
being typed, indeed succeeding at that. As it got mildly popular within the
related circles, the topic of bots was raised, which led to this API.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Low-level communication</h3>
<p>Clients communicate with the server by sending (and receiving) octets over
a TCP channel, which are to be mapped to ASCII codepoints. UTF-8 is not
employed as not all endpoints are guaranteed to use it; opt-in support may be
added upon popular demand.</p>
<p>As far as this API is concerned, communication is always line-based; lines
are terminated with the line feed (<tt>\x0A</tt>) character.</p>
<h3>Initial handshake</h3>
<p>Initially, the connection is in <em>doorstep mode</em>, the server,
assuming a human client, sends a textual greeting after a version
advertisement. A human client would configure certain properties of themself
&mdash; the terminal type and the nickname &mdash; and join; bots can enable
<em>API mode</em> instead.</p>
<h4>Server lines</h4>
<p><em>Comment lines</em> are sent for human users' information; they begin
with a number sign (<tt>#</tt>) and can be safely ignored. Lines relevant to
the API are split into <em>words</em> by whitespace; they can be
discriminated by their first word:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>WHBCS</tt> &mdash; <strong>Version advertisement</strong>: Sent by
WHBCS as the very first line, with the version following the heading as a
second word. Additional words may be specified in the future. The version
this API applies to is <tt>v1.5</tt>, servers with a higher minor version
shall behave downwards-compatibly (though such with a higher major version
may not).</li>
<li><tt>OK</tt> &mdash; <strong>Acknowledgement</strong>: Indicates a
client-side command was successful. Further words may be specified in the
future. A word consisting of a single number sign indicates the end of
API-relevant payload and the beginning of comments for human users.</li>
<li><tt>FAIL</tt> &mdash; <strong>Failure</strong>: Indicates a command was
not successful. Syntax similar to <tt>OK</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>PONG</tt> &mdash; <strong>Ping reply</strong>: Sent as a reply to a
<tt>/ping</tt> command, which can be used to probe connection connectivity.
The syntax is again similar to <tt>OK</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Client lines</h4>
<p>For continuity with in-chat commands, client-side lines begin with a slash
(<tt>/</tt>) character. Out of the commands, only <tt>/api</tt> is relevant
to API clients, it changes the connection into API mode. The server's reply
will still conform to the protocol described in this subsection
(<em>i.e.</em>, be either a <tt>OK</tt> or a <tt>FAIL</tt>).</p>
<p>Other notable commands include <tt>/ping</tt>, which results in the server
sending a <tt>PONG</tt> reply, and <tt>/quit</tt>, which lets WHBCS terminate
the connection (after performing some clean-up, which is not necessary in API
mode); a list (with terse descriptions; <small>not including the
<tt>/api</tt> command</small>) can be obtained by using the <tt>/help</tt>
command interactively.</p>
<h3>API mode format</h3>
<p>In API mode, the commands mentioned earlier are complemented by <em>JSON
objects</em> as the main means of transporting data; the separation of words
is irrelevant for those, and should not be performed. More exactly, lines
starting with the opening brace character (<tt>{</tt>) are interpreted as
JSON messages by WHBCS, and the server sends all its messages in JSON
format.</p>
<aside><strong>Note</strong> that messages not starting with a brace will be
interpreted as in non-API mode; commands can be used and messages can be sent
(if the API client has joined properly), although this behavior is
discouraged.</aside>
