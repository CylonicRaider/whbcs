<aside>Revision 8, as of 2017-03-12</aside>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><em>WHBCS</em> came into existence after I had a <tt>netcat</tt> chat with
an acquaintance, showing that such a client-less chat has both the merit of
not having to install a client and the expense of the other's messages
interrupting the own typing; additionally, only two people could participate
in such a conversation. After that, I wrote up WHBCS, trying to use some ANSI
escape codes to make others' messages appear above the own one being typed,
indeed succeeding at that. As it got mildly popular within the related
circles, the topic of bots was raised, which led to this API.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Low-level communication</h3>
<p>Clients communicate with the server by sending (and receiving) octets over
a TCP channel, which are to be mapped to ASCII codepoints. Encryption is
currently not used; UTF-8 is not employed at this level as not all clients
are guaranteed to use it; API clients can encode Unicode via means elaborated
below, but should be aware that not all clients may receive it properly.</p>
<p>As far as this API is concerned, communication is always line-based; lines
are terminated with the line feed (<tt>\x0A</tt>) character; leading and
trailing whitespace should be ignored.</p>
<p>In doorstep mode (defined below), the connection is synchronous; in
API mode, is becomes full-duplex. <small>(There are half-duplex modes of
direct communications with the user; they are out of the scope of this
API.)</small>

<h3>Initial handshake</h3>
<p>Initially, the connection is in <em>doorstep mode</em>; the server,
assuming a human client, sends a textual greeting after a version
advertisement. A human client would configure certain properties of themself
&mdash; the terminal type and the nickname &mdash; and join; bots can enable
<em>API mode</em> instead.</p>

<h4>Server lines</h4>
<p><em>Comment lines</em> are sent for human users' information; they begin
with a number sign (<tt>#</tt>) and can be safely ignored. Lines relevant to
the API are split into <em>words</em> by whitespace; they can be
discriminated by their first word:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>WHBCS</tt> &mdash; <strong>Version advertisement</strong>: Sent by
WHBCS as the very first line, with the version following the heading as a
second word. Additional words may be specified in the future. Servers with
higher minor versions shall behave downwards-compatibly to those with the
same major version; servers with different major versions may be mutually
incompatible.</li>
<li><tt>OK</tt> &mdash; <strong>Acknowledgement</strong>: Indicates a
client-side command was successful. Further words may be specified in the
future. A word consisting of a single number sign indicates the end of
API-relevant payload and the beginning of comments for human users.</li>
<li><tt>FAIL</tt> &mdash; <strong>Failure</strong>: Indicates a command was
not successful. Syntax similar to <tt>OK</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>PONG</tt> &mdash; <strong>Ping reply</strong>: Sent as a reply to a
<tt>/ping</tt> command, which can be used to probe connection connectivity.
The syntax is again similar to <tt>OK</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Client lines</h4>
<p>For continuity with in-chat commands, client-side lines begin with a slash
(<tt>/</tt>) character. Of the commands, only <tt>/api</tt> is relevant to
API clients; it switches the connection into API mode. The reply to the
<tt>/api</tt> command is still sent in the mode described above (<i>i.e.</i>,
it is an <tt>OK</tt> or <tt>FAIL</tt> line); all further messages from the
server &mdash; including replies to "legacy" commands &mdash; are sent in the
format elaborated below.</p>
<p>Other notable commands include <tt>/ping</tt>, which results in the server
sending a <tt>PONG</tt> reply, and <tt>/quit</tt>, which lets WHBCS terminate
the connection (after performing some clean-up, which is not necessary in API
mode); a non-machine-readable list <small>(not including the <tt>/api</tt>
command)</small> can be obtained by using the <tt>/help</tt> command
interactively.</p>

<h3>API mode format</h3>
<p>In API mode, the commands mentioned earlier are complemented by <em>JSON
objects</em> as the main means of transporting data; the separation of words
is irrelevant for those, and should not be performed. More exactly, lines
starting with the opening brace character (<tt>{</tt>) are interpreted as
JSON messages by WHBCS, and the server sends all its messages in JSON
format.</p>
<aside><h5>Note</h5> that messages not starting with a brace will be
interpreted as in non-API mode; commands can be used and messages can be sent
(if the API client has joined properly), although this behavior is
discouraged.</aside>

<h2>API messages</h2>
<p>The client and the server may send messages at any time (asynchronously);
the server guarantees to process the client's commands in the order they
arrive at the server (and, therefore, most probably are sent). As noted
above, messages are encoded as JSON objects.</p>

<h3>Common attributes</h3>
<p>This section specifies attributes common to all object types, and those
common to "top-level" objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>type</tt> &mdash; <strong>Object type</strong>: The semantical type
of the object. The value is a string. Note that objects may be nested inside
each other, so this is not limited to message types.</li>
<li><tt>variant</tt> &mdash; <strong>Type differentiation</strong>: Indicates
a different "sub-type", or a different role an object has. As <tt>type</tt>,
the value is a string. <i>E.g.</i>, the <tt><b>post</b></tt> type has the
variants <tt>normal</tt> and <tt>emote</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>content</tt> &mdash; <strong>Main content</strong>: Stores, well, the
main content of the object. Can be of an arbitrary type.</li>
<li><tt>text</tt> &mdash; <strong>Textual representation</strong>: The
server's preferred way of presenting the given object, as used for terminal
clients. May be absent, indicating the server does not honor this object with
a textual representation. The value may be a string, or an array of strings
and/or nested objects, which can have <tt>text</tt> fields as well. Objects
without <tt>text</tt> fields are provided as context and would not be
rendered into text by the server itself. The emission of <tt>text</tt> fields
is configurable (to save bandwidth) by updating the <tt><b>send-text</b></tt>
variable.<br/>
If an object does not have a <tt>text</tt> attribute, but its
<tt>content</tt> member has, the latter's shall be used instead,
recursively.</li>
<li><tt>prefix</tt> &mdash; <strong>Textual representation prefix</strong>:
A piece of text (or a formatted object) that should be prepended to
<tt>text</tt>, but does not semantically belong to it itself. For example, a
<tt><b>mention</b></tt> object would have a prefix containing the sigil
character that introduced the mention.<br/>
If multiple objects' members are composed (such as when an object has no
<tt>text</tt> member but its <tt>content</tt> has), the combination of the
<tt>prefix</tt>, <tt>text</tt>, and <tt>postfix</tt> of the <tt>content</tt>
shall be treated as equivalent to the (absent) <tt>text</tt> member of the
parent (<i>i.e.</i> the parent's <tt>prefix</tt> shall be prepended to the
<tt>prefix</tt> of the child, <i>etc.</i>).</li>
<li><tt>postfix</tt> &mdash; <strong>Textual representation postfix</strong>:
The equivalent of <tt>prefix</tt> that should be appended to the
<tt>text</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following fields apply mostly to top-level messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>seq</tt> &mdash; <strong>Sequence number</strong>: An arbitrary value
set by the client in requests; server replies to those will include it
unmodified. Use is optional.</li>
<li><tt>timestamp</tt> &mdash; <strong>Timestamp</strong>: A UNIX timestamp
of when roughly the current object was constructed. The value is a
floating-point number; while the unit is a second, more precision may be
available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client commands</h3>
<p>The section titles list the <tt>type</tt> attributes to set. "Modified"
asynchronous events &mdash; which are frequently sent as replies &mdash; are
distinguished by containing the sequence number of the corresponding request
(if any).</p>

<h4><tt>ping</tt></h4>
<p>Lets the server return a <tt>pong</tt> message. Can be used to probe
connectivity.</p>

<h4><tt>query</tt></h4>
<p>Asks the server to inform the client about some of its state.
<tt>content</tt> is a <tt><b>variable</b></tt> without a <tt>value</tt>
indicating what to query. The server returns either a
<tt><b>success</b></tt> or a <tt><b>failure</b></tt>, depending on whether
the request is valid, and whether the client is allowed to perform it.</p>

<h4><tt>update</tt></h4>
<p>Asks the server to change some client state, similarly to
<tt><b>query</b></tt>. The <tt>content</tt> contains a <tt>value</tt>, which
tells what to change the variable to. The reply is a modified
<tt><b>updated</b></tt> message in case of success, or a regular
<tt><b>failure</b></tt>.</p>

<h4><tt>join</tt></h4>
<p>Tells the server the client is ready to enter chat. A modified
<tt><b>joined</b></tt> is sent to the client as confirmation.</p>

<h4><tt>leave</tt></h4>
<p>Tells the server that the client wants to leave chat again. A modified
<tt><b>left</b></tt> is sent to the client as confirmation.</p>

<h4><tt>send</tt></h4>
<p>Sends a chat message. <tt>content</tt> is a <tt><b>post</b></tt>
specifying what exactly to send. The <tt><b>post</b></tt>'s
<tt>content</tt> may be a plain string, letting the server interpret it, and
is in fact currently required to be like that. The server replies with a
modified <tt><b>chat</b></tt>.</p>

<h4><tt>quit</tt></h4>
<p>Tells the server to remove the client from chat (if there) and to close
the connection.</p>

<h3>Server replies</h3>
<p>Generic synchronous replies to commands.</p>

<h4><tt>pong</tt></h4>
<p>Indicates a <tt>ping</tt> command was received.</p>

<h4><tt>success</tt></h4>
<p>Indicates that a command succeeded. <tt>content</tt> may contain reply
data.</p>

<h4><tt>failure</tt></h4>
<p>Indicates that a command failed. <tt>content</tt> contains an
<tt><b>error</b></tt> object.</p>

<h3>Asynchronous events</h3>
<p>These messages are sent by the server when events of interest to clients
happen. In each case, the <tt>text</tt> field of the message contains &mdash;
as noted above &mdash; a rich-text representation of the event if the server
deems one appropriate.</p>

<h4><tt>updated</tt></h4>
<p>A client changed a public variable about themself. The <tt>from</tt>
field contains a <tt><b>variable</b></tt> denoting the state before the
change, the <tt>content</tt> field the one after it.</p>

<h4><tt>joined</tt></h4>
<p>A client joined the room. <tt>content</tt> is a <tt><b>user</b></tt>
object containing details about the newly-joined participant.</p>

<h4><tt>left</tt></h4>
<p>A client left. <tt>content</tt> &mdash; symmetrically to
<tt><b>joined</b></tt> &mdash; elaborates on which client exactly left.
<tt>variant</tt> may be <tt>normal</tt> or <tt>abrupt</tt>, denoting whether
the client disconnected "properly" (<i>i.e.</i>, by a <tt><b>leave</b></tt>
or a <tt><b>quit</b></tt>) or not, respectively.</p>

<h4><tt>chat</tt></h4>
<p>A chat message was posted. <tt>content</tt> contains a
<tt><b>post</b></tt> representing the chat message.</p>

<h4><tt>sysmsg</tt></h4>
<p>A system message from the server. The <tt>text</tt> fields contains
more details.</p>

<h3>In-message data types</h3>

<h4><tt>variable</tt></h4>
<p>A piece of information about a client. Fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>name</tt> &mdash; <strong>Variable name</strong>: Indicates which
variable is exactly meant.</li>
<li><tt>value</tt> &mdash; <strong>Variable value</strong>: Contains the
value the variable has. May be missing in queries.</li>
<li><tt>id</tt> &mdash; <strong>Client identifier</strong>: An opaque
primitive value uniquely identifying a client. Currently an integer, but
might become a string in the future. May be re-used after a client exits or
server restarts. If omitted, either the current client is meant (in client
requests), or the client is not explicitly identified (such as inside
<tt><b>mention</b></tt>-s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently defined variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>nick</tt> &mdash; <strong>Nickname</strong>: A string the client
chose as the nickname for themself.</li>
<li><tt>term</tt> &mdash; <strong>Terminal type</strong> <em>(private)</em>:
The terminal of the client. Of little use to API clients.</li>
<li><tt>send-text</tt> &mdash; <strong>Send <tt>text</tt> fields</strong>
<em>(private)</em>: Informs the server whether it should format and send
<tt><b>text</b></tt> fields to the client, or if the latter will disregard
them. Can be used to save bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p>...where annotations mean:</p>
<dl>
<dt>private</dt>
<dd>Only the own value can be queried/modified.</dd>
</dl>

<h4><tt>error</tt></h4>
<p>An error reply. Fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>code</tt> &mdash; <strong>Error code</strong>: A short alphanumeric
string identifying the error in a machine-readable way.</li>
<li><tt>text</tt> &mdash; <strong>Error message</strong>: A human-readable
explanation of the error; may be a string or an array of strings and objects
as is generally the case with <tt>text</tt> members.</li>
</ul>

<h4><tt>post</tt></h4>
<p>An individual chat message. <tt>variant</tt> may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>normal</tt> &mdash; <strong>Normal post</strong>: Semantically
equals the client "saying" something.</li>
<li><tt>emote</tt> &mdash; <strong>Emote message</strong>: Describes the
client's state or actions in the third person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Field assignments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>sender</tt> &mdash; <strong>Post origin</strong>: The
<tt><b>user</b></tt> the message came from.</li>
<li><tt>content</tt> &mdash; <strong>Raw text</strong>: The (nearly)
unfiltered text the client has sent.</li>
<li><tt>text</tt> &mdash; <strong>Rich text</strong>: An array of strings
and objects providing the post content along with semantic
meta-information.</li>
<li><tt>timestamp</tt> &mdash; <strong>Timestamp</strong>: <em>See <b>Common
Attributes</b> for explanation.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4><tt>user</tt></h4>
<p>An individual chat participant. Extra fields are <tt>id</tt> and
<tt>nick</tt>; see <tt><b>variable</b></tt> for definitions of the values.</p>

<h4><tt>mention</tt></h4>
<p>An <tt>@</tt>-mention of a client. Appears inside the <tt>text</tt> of
<tt><b>post</b></tt>-s. The <tt>content</tt> field identifies (partially) the
<tt><b>user</b></tt> mentioned.</p>

<h4><tt>hl</tt></h4>
<p>A piece of text that does not carry particular semantical meaning, but
still can be highlighted in a certain way. Most notably used in
<tt><b>text</b></tt> members of messages. <tt>variant</tt> contains
detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>reply</tt> &mdash; <strong>Server reply</strong>: A reply keyword as
elaborated upon in a previous section. Since the API already provides that
information, they keyword is decorational only.
<pre>
<mark>OK</mark> # USAGE: /help [command] -- Display help.
</pre></li>
<li><tt>replypad</tt> &mdash; <strong>Server reply framing</strong>:
Characters surrounding a reply to a command. Again, as the information is
already present in the API message, this only serves to create an air of
homogeneity for the end-user.
<pre>
OK <mark>#</mark> USAGE: /help [command] -- Display help.
</pre></li>
<li><tt>syspad</tt> &mdash; <strong>Server message framing</strong>:
Characters surrounding a server message.
<pre>
<mark>***</mark> Server will shut down now.
</pre></li>
<li><tt>sysmsg</tt> &mdash; <strong>Server message</strong>: A message from
the server for users' information.
<pre>
*** <mark>Server will shut down now.</mark>
</pre></li>
<li><tt>msgpad</tt> &mdash; <strong>Chat message padding</strong>: Characters
surrounding a "normal" chat message.
<pre>
<mark>*</mark> <i>Gary</i> is now <i>Fred</i>
</pre></li>
<li><tt>msgtext</tt> &mdash; <strong>Chat message text</strong>: Actual
content of an in-chat message.
<pre>
* <mark><i>Gary</i> is now <i>Fred</i></mark>
</pre></li>
<li><tt>msgerr</tt> &mdash; <strong>Chat error message</strong>: A message
indicating a bad condition.
<pre>
* <mark><i>Alice</i> left unexpectedly</mark>
</pre></li>
<li><tt>chatpad</tt> &mdash; <strong>Chat padding</strong>: Characters
surrounding various parts of a chat post.
<pre>
<mark>&lt;</mark>Fred<mark>&gt;</mark> Hello!
</pre></li>
<li><tt>spc</tt> &mdash; <strong>Space</strong>: Characters used to separate
different parts of the line.
<pre>
&lt;Fred&gt;<mark> </mark>Hello!
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4><tt>char</tt></h4>
<p>A non-ASCII character encountered in a <tt><b>post</b></tt>. The
<tt>content</tt> field is a single-character string containing the original
value; the <tt>text</tt> holds a replacement character (<i>e.g.</i>, a
<tt>?</tt>).</p>
